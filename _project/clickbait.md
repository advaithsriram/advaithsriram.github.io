## *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*
<!-- ## Summary

[Add a brief overview of the project here. Describe the main objective, approach, and significance of the work.]

- **Objective**: [Main goal - e.g., Classify YouTube video titles as clickbait or non-clickbait]
- **Dataset**: [Dataset used for training/testing]
- **Key Technologies**: [List main technologies, algorithms, or frameworks used - e.g., NLP, Machine Learning models]
- **Team**: [Team members or solo project]

---

## Motivation

[Explain why clickbait detection is important, the impact of clickbait on user experience, and what problem this project solves.]

---

## Approach

[Describe your methodology, data processing pipeline, and model architecture.]

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

[Describe how data was collected, cleaned, and preprocessed. Include details about text normalization, tokenization, etc.]

### Model Architecture

[Describe the machine learning or deep learning model(s) used - e.g., Transformer-based models, LSTM, BERT, etc.]

### Training and Evaluation

[Describe training process, hyperparameters, validation strategy, and evaluation metrics used.]

## Example Predictions

[Optional: Show some example predictions with clickbait vs. non-clickbait titles]

**Clickbait Examples:**
- [Example title 1] → Predicted: Clickbait ✓
- [Example title 2] → Predicted: Clickbait ✓

**Non-Clickbait Examples:**
- [Example title 1] → Predicted: Not Clickbait ✓
- [Example title 2] → Predicted: Not Clickbait ✓
