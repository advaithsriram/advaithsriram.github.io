### Summary

This project involved developing a navigation pipeline for the **Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.1** nano drone to autonomously fly through a sequence of gates. In simulation, the drone detects gates using computer vision, computes their position through triangulation, and navigates a course with both precision and speed. On the real hardware, physical gate positions and dimensions were predefined, so no vision-based detection was required. The main challenge was designing a robust trajectory controller to autonomously navigate through the gate sequence using the known waypoints

- **Environment**: Webots Simulation & Real Hardware (Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.1)
- **Objective**: Navigate 2 full laps through 4 spatially placed gates  
- **Libraries**: `crazyflie-lib-python`, OpenCV, Webots API  
- **Team**: Advaith Sriram, Federico Rocca, Teo Halevi, Yugo Kadowaki, Nevò Mirzai

### Simulation Phase

Using **Webots**, we simulated a randomized gate course in 3D space. The drone’s onboard camera captured images of the environment, and gates were detected using a **color-based segmentation + contour detection** pipeline.

- Triangulation was used to compute gate position from edge and center points
- Navigation was done by computing entry and exit vectors, rather than passing through the center, to improve robustness
- Multiple laps were executed, with the first lap for detection and mapping, and subsequent laps optimized for speed

### Hardware Implementation

After successful simulation tests, the codebase was adapted to work with the **Crazyflie 2.1** drone:

- Interfaced with the drone via the **`crazyflie-lib-python`** library
- Flight commands were executed in real-time from a ground station
- Navigation setpoints were set with entry/exit points rather than gate centers for improved robustness
