## 👥 Leadership & Community

As part of my extracurricular involvement at Waseda University, I co-founded the **Google Developer Groups on Campus (GDGoC)** chapter at **Waseda University** in 2021, a Google-backed student tech community where I served as **President** from 2022-23.

🌱 Built and led a growing, interdisciplinary community of students passionate about technology and innovation
🛠️ Organized workshops, hackathons, and speaker sessions in collaboration with Google Japan
🧠 Gained practical experience in leadership, communication, teamwork, and decision-making
🤝 Fostered interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering, design, and business students

<!-- As a strong believer in open-source culture and peer learning, I co-founded the **Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)** chapter at **Waseda University** in 2021, where I served as **President** from 2022-23.

- 🚀 Built a student tech community from the ground up with a focus on **AI, robotics, and cloud development**
- 🎤 Organized and hosted multiple hands-on workshops, including sessions on **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Python for robotics**
- 🌍 Collaborated with Google DevRel and student leaders across APAC to bring technical talks and mentorship to campus
- 🤝 Fostered interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering, design, and business students

This experience deepened my commitment to accessible tech education and helped me develop key leadership and project coordination skills alongside my technical work. -->
