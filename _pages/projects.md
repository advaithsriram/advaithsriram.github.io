## [Bachelor Thesis: Human-to-Robot Handover of Large Objects using Pose Estimation to Overcome Hand Occlusion](../project/robot-handover)
**Type**: Bachelor Thesis | **Institution**: Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan

**Summary**: 
- Developed a DNN regression model using a pose-driven approach for overcoming hand occlusion in human-to-robot large-object handover
- Compared 3 camera types: A standard RGB camera, a Fisheye camera, and a Fisheye camera with distortion correction
- Published in International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2023.
