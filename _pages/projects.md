## [ABB x AI Driven Choreography](../project/ai-choreo)
**Type**: Semester Project | **Institution**: EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland 

**Summary**: 
- Implemented an interactive exhibit using a **ABB GoFa CRB 15000** robot arm, combining **AI-driven choreography** with artistic expression. 
- The system maps music to expressive robot motion using a custom-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and incorporates **real-time hand tracking** for interaction. 
- Exhibited at the **Swiss Design Awards 2025**.

## [Bachelor Thesis: Human-to-Robot Handover of Large Objects using Pose Estimation to Overcome Hand Occlusion](../project/robot-handover)
**Type**: Bachelor Thesis | **Institution**: Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan

**Summary**: 
- Developed a DNN regression model using a pose-driven approach for overcoming hand occlusion in human-to-robot large-object handover
- Compared model performance with 3 camera types: A standard RGB camera, a Fisheye camera, and a Fisheye camera with distortion correction
- Published in International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10610777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publication Link</a>

## [Reinforcement Learning for Legged Locomotion Simulation](../project/legged-rl)
<!-- **Type**: Course Project | **Course**: Legged Robots ([MICRO-507](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/legged-robots-MICRO-507)) @ EPFL   -->
**Type**: Course Project | **Course**: Legged Robots <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/legged-robots-MICRO-507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MICRO-507</a> @ EPFL

**Summary**: 
- Explored the use of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to train a simulated quadruped robot (Unitree A1) to walk over **challenging terrains** including slopes and stairs. 
- Using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and a custom controller framework, the robot learned stable locomotion strategies across uneven surfaces without relying on a reference gait. 
- Explored the effects of different action spaces, observation spaces, and reward functions on various terrains.

## [Simulation and Hardware Project: Crazyflie Drone](../project/aerial)
<!-- **Type**: Course Project | **Course**: Aerial Robotics ([MICRO-502](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/aerial-robotics-MICRO-502)) @ EPFL   -->
**Type**: Course Project | **Course**: Aerial Robotics <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/aerial-robotics-MICRO-502" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MICRO-502</a> @ EPFL 

**Summary**:
- Developed a navigation pipeline for the **Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.1** nano drone to autonomously fly through a sequence of gates. 
- **Simulation**: The drone detects gates using computer vision, computes their position through triangulation, and navigates a course. 
- **Hardware**: On the real hardware, physical gate positions and dimensions were predefined, and a robust trajectory controller was developed to autonomously navigate through the gates
