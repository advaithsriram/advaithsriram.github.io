## [ABB x AI Driven Choreography](../project/ai-choreo)
**Type**: Semester Project | **Institution**: EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland 

**Summary**: 
- Implemented an interactive exhibit using a **ABB GoFa CRB 15000** robot arm, combining **AI-driven choreography** with artistic expression. 
- The system maps music to expressive robot motion using a custom-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and incorporates **real-time hand tracking** for interaction. 
- Exhibited at the **Swiss Design Awards 2025**.

## [Bachelor Thesis: Human-to-Robot Handover of Large Objects using Pose Estimation to Overcome Hand Occlusion](../project/robot-handover)
**Type**: Bachelor Thesis | **Institution**: Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan

**Summary**: 
- Developed a DNN regression model using a pose-driven approach for overcoming hand occlusion in human-to-robot large-object handover
- Compared model performance with 3 camera types: A standard RGB camera, a Fisheye camera, and a Fisheye camera with distortion correction
- Published in International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2024. [Publication Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10610777)
